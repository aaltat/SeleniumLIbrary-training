# Demo suite
This folder suite contains example suite structure which is done by using
SeleniumLibrary and Robot Framework test data syntax.

 # Running tests
 Use a python script `run.py` to execute all the test. The `run.py`
 also demonstrates how creating simple running eases test execution.
 See `python run.py --help` for more details about script arguments.
